#### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? 
```bash
Around four to five hours
```

#### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
```bash
The language used in this project is TypeScript. Some of the most useful features of the latest version of TypeScript (as of TypeScript 4.9) include:

1. Satisfies Operator: Ensures that an expression matches a specific type without changing the type of the expression.
2. Template Literal Types: Enhanced support for template literal types, allowing more complex string manipulations and validations.
3. Exact Optional Property Types: More precise handling of optional properties in types.
4. Type-Only Imports and Exports: Ability to import and export types without including the actual code, reducing bundle size and improving performance.
```

#### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
```bash
We can do the following:
1. Use profiling tools to identify code sections with high CPU or memory consumption. 
2. Examine network traffic to check for latency issues or bottlenecks.

I have not done this before.
```

#### 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
```bash
1. I would try to make UI a bit more atractive
2. Editing tasks in place
3. Sending a reminder for the tasks completion through mail or  to the user
4. I would implement signup and login functionalities for make this app more personalized secure
5. I would use database instead of local storage to make this app a bit more complex.
```
